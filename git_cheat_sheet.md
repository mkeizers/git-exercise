# Basic git commands

## git clone
clones an existing repository, that you created in GitHub or similar, into your current directory

## git add 
adds file(s) into the staging area. Any changes that are done to these files now do not affect the files in the staging area

## git restore
discards changes of your file which were not added to the staging area already
###	--staged: removes files from your staging area - does not override the current version!

## git commit
commit everything which is in your staging area into your repository!
###	-m: directly add a commit message to your commit

## git push
push everything from your reposotory into the remote repository (can now be seen in your GitHub repositoryy e.g.)

## git mv
Rename your file - if you push, the old file will automatically be renamed as well - no new file will be added
